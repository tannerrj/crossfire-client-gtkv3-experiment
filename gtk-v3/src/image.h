/**
 * @file image.h
 * Pixmap data.  This is abstracted in the sense that the code here does not
 * care what the data points to (hence the void).  The module using this data
 * should know whether it is these point to png data or image data of whatever
 * form.  The module is not required to use all these fields - as png data
 * includes transparancy, it will generally not use the mask fields and instead
 * just put its data into the appropriate image fields.
 *
 * As images can now be of variable size (and potentially re-sized), the size
 * information is stored here.
